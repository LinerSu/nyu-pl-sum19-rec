## Note
- The idea to design a procedure is very similar to write a pattern matching in functional language. You should consider several cases (patterns) for arguments and add subgoals to fulfill each case if necessary.
- For debugging, you can use `trace.` mode to observe the behavior of your procedure.
    - type `nodebug.` to exit the trace mode.
- Using cut operator or negate operator is very helpful for your implementation.
